# Ethereum Agent Network Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and implementation details for building agent networks on Ethereum, focusing on decentralized identity management, smart contract orchestration, and peer-to-peer communication protocols.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Registry System
- **Smart Contracts**:
  - Agent Registration Contract: Maps agent DIDs to metadata (capabilities, endpoints, reputation)
  - Service Discovery Contract: Categorizes agents by functional capabilities
  - Reputation Management Contract: Implements social credit system for agent reliability

### 2. Identity Management
- Uses Ethereum DIDs (`did:ethr` format)
- Supports key rotation and identity attribute updates
- Implements challenge-response authentication
- Maintains secure communication sessions

### 3. Multi-Signature Coordination
- Implements "Swarm Contract" approach
- Uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)
- Maintains private key isolation
- Supports multi-agent consensus

### 4. Networking Layer
- **Communication Protocols**:
  - DevP2P integration for agent-to-agent communication
  - Hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture
  - libp2p for peer-to-peer networking

### 5. Agent Discovery
- **Protocols**:
  - Active Discovery: On-chain registry queries with semantic search
  - Passive Discovery: Distributed search services
  - JSON-LD format for structured agent descriptions

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Hierarchical Multi-Blockchain
- **Layers**:
  - Global: Cross-regional coordination
  - Regional: Domain-specific agent clusters
  - Local: Direct agent-to-agent interactions

### 2. TEE-Based Deployment
- Secure enclaves for private key management
- Remote attestation for code verification
- Sovereign agent state management

### 3. Smart Contract Development
- Registry contract structure
- Multi-signature wallet integration
- Agent coordination protocols

### 4. Security Mechanisms
- DID-based identity verification
- Session management
- Reputation systems
- Governance integration

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Network Initialization
1. Deploy core contracts
2. Configure P2P infrastructure
3. Implement security measures
4. Test agent registration

### 2. Scaling Strategies
- Layer 2 integration
- Cross-chain compatibility
- Resource optimization

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Smart Contracts
- Agent registry
- Service discovery
- Reputation management
- Multi-signature coordination

### 2. Networking
- libp2p integration
- DevP2P protocols
- P2P communication layer

### 3. Security
- TEE implementation
- Key management
- Authentication protocols
