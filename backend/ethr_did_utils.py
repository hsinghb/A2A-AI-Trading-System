# (Demo: simulate generating an Ethereum key pair (e.g. via Web3 or Ethers) and then deriving a DID URI (e.g. “did:ethr:<ethereum_address>”) (for an Ethereum address) (i.e. “did:ethr:” + <ethereum_address>).)
# In a real system, you'd generate an Ethereum key pair (e.g. via Web3 or Ethers) (i.e. an Ethereum address (controlled by its private key) and a private key) and then instantiate an EthrDID object (e.g. via "new EthrDID({ address, privateKey, provider })") (using that address and private key) to derive a DID URI (e.g. "did:ethr:<ethereum_address>") (for an Ethereum address) (i.e. "did:ethr:" + <ethereum_address>).
# For demo purposes, we'll simulate (using a mock Ethereum address (e.g. "0x" + "0" * 40) and a dummy private key (e.g. "0x" + "1" * 64) and a dummy provider (None)) the creation of a DID (did:ethr:<ethereum_address>) (and return a dict (with keys "did" and "private_key")).
